# About/ Overview

This application represents a maze based game with a dungeon consisting of a network of caves and tunnels interconnected with eachother. This network of caves and tunnels must be travered by the player to reach from start to the end node. Some of the caves in the Dungeon contain Monsters which must be slayed with arrows to cross the cave. Entering a cave with an alive monster will lead to the player's death. The player will initially be given 3 arrows but can collect more arrows scattered around the cells of the dungeon. The player needs to shoot 2 arrows to kill the monster.

The player will only have knowledge of the starting location and the current location but will not be having any knowledge of the exit node. The maze uncovers as the player travels through the network. The player can move in 4 directions: North, South, East, West to traverse in the dungeon. The player can also collect treasures from caves along the way. The game comes to an end once the player reaches the exit node alive!

This java application provides a software implementation for this type of game. This application exposes a rich and interactive User interface that can be used to perform various actions in the game for the player to win.
